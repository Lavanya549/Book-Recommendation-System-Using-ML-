# Book Recommendation System Using Machine Learning

# Project Overview  
1. The Book Recommendation System is designed to suggest books to users based on their preferences and reading history.  
2. It uses machine learning algorithms to analyze user behavior and recommend personalized book suggestions.  
3. The system ensures users receive relevant recommendations, improving their reading experience.

# Key Features 
1. **Content-Based Filtering:** Recommends books similar to the user's past interests based on book metadata (e.g., genre, author, keywords).  
2. **Collaborative Filtering:** Suggests books by analyzing the preferences of users with similar tastes.  
3. **Hybrid Approach:** Combines content-based and collaborative filtering for better accuracy.  
4. **User-Friendly Interface:** Allows users to search, view, and receive recommendations seamlessly.  
5. **Interactive Dashboard:** Displays insights like popular books and trending genres.
